As always, I learned a lot and struggled even more. FEM really does love those background images, don't they? I felt position: absolute was neccessary here for the avatar and buttons but it does break my heart as I try to get it to be responsive.

Three things that I couldn't figure out:

The position of the person/student is not printing on screen when I click the btns - it seems to be something with the .textContent as I have done the console.logs up to that bit and all works fine.

The max-width in my media query for the container is not working - that has never not worked for me before so I can't figure out what I am doing wron this time.

The box shadow under the button container is only on one side and should be on both. Maybe I should just do a box shadow on an invisible line under the image instead?
